# Networks Laboratory

Welcome to Networks Lab, where you basically create pointless C programs. You may not learn anything particularly useful but you can get kinda good grades ;)  
Here you can find my implementation of those C programs.  
**Note**: since no one really writes these programs from scratch, the comments might not make sense and there may be unused variables and unnecessary code.
